# Keyboard & Xbox Controller

We can stream video from Python. Now it is time to move towards the "bot" portion of RTCBot: robot control. With the previous tutorials, a robot's webcam can be streamed to
the browser. Now, what we want is to send commands from the keyboard or Xbox controller
in the browser, back to Python! This will allow true remote control, with you watching a video feed on your computer, and controlling the robot with your keyboard, while the robot roams around your house.

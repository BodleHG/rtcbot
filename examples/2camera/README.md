# Streaming a Camera

In the previous tutorial, a basic skeleton project was set up, which created a data connection between the server and a browser.
This tutorial will start with the previous one's code, and add on a live-streaming PiCamera to our connection.

You should use a browser on your laptop or desktop for this one, and put the server on a Raspberry Pi if you want to try streaming from the PiCamera.
